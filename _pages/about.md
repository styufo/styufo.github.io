I am a third-year M.Sc. student at the [Department of Cyber Science and Technology](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/) of [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) advised by Professor [Jiu-Xin Cao](https://cyber.seu.edu.cn/_s303/_t1536/cjx/list.psp) (曹玖新).


I received my B.Sc. degree from the Department of Communication Engineering of [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/). In September 2021, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree at Southeast University without an entrance examination.
